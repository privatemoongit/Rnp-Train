the same it will not show them on top of each other but remove the first showen
variant then display the second one.

Label: markers where you can use the goto with the #jump statement Labels may
be defined in any file that is in the game directory, and ends with .rpy.
The filename doesn't matter to Ren'Py, only the labels contained inside it.
You can think of all the .rpy files as being equivalent to a single big .rpy
file, with jumps used to transfer control. This gives you flexibility in how
you organize the script of a larger game.
  # label option_one
  # label option_two
  # label option_tree

Jump: goto command to go to the specified #label
  # jump option_one
  # jump option_two
  # jump option_tree

Menu: a select one menu to the player to use when offered a choise. Indenting
and " : " is mandatory. It will go lineary so if it is jumps to option_two and
do not have any jumping forward then it will go to the next option.
  # menu:
        # "Option one":
          # jump option_one
        # "Option two":
          # jump option_two
        # "Option tree":
          # jump option_tree
